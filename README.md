# Roulette Wheel Spin Tracker v1.0
This is a python script for use on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, using a PiCamera
that allows a Roulette croupier to track spins of the roulette wheel, display
the resulting numbers in a casino-styled display format, as well as other
statistics and pictures of the wheel. Version 2.0 will have some kind of
automatic ball tracking and reporting via the camera
